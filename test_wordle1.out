Would you like to read the instructions? (y/N)

WORDLE is a word-guessing game. For every round, a random five-letter
word is chosen. You have to guess the word in 6 guesses. You cannot
guess words you have guessed before, and every word must be a word
in our dictionary. Below is an example of output if the actual word
is "yerba" and the guess is "kelpy".
 --- --- --- --- --- 
| k | e | l | p | y |
 --- --- --- --- --- 
 --- --- --- --- --- 
| X | C | X | X | I |
 --- --- --- --- --- 
"C" in the corresponding box below means the letter in the guess is
in the correct spot. "I" means that the letter is in the word, but 
not in the right spot. "X" means the letter is not in the word.
